## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Features | 46 |
| Passed | 46 |
| Failed | 0 |
| Pass Rate | **100%** |

## Fixes Applied

None required. All features passed on first attempt.

## Stuck Items

None. All features verified successfully.

## Evidence Checksums

See `evidence/sha256sums.txt` for integrity verification.

## Readiness Decision

### ✅ **Ready**

**Rationale:**
- All 41 features pass verification
- 7/7 async integration tests pass
- All core modules instantiate correctly
- All agents instantiate correctly
- GUI renders successfully (DISPLAY=:1 available)
- LLM client initializes (using Ollama provider)
- Config files valid YAML
- Database has all required tables

### Remaining Risks (Low)

1. **LLM API calls** - Client initializes but actual API calls require:
   - OpenAI: valid `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Ollama: running `ollama serve` with pulled model
   
2. **Network-dependent features** - Web search requires internet connectivity

### Follow-ups (Optional)

1. Add end-to-end test with real Ollama model
2. Add network connectivity check to health_check.py
3. Add automated screenshot capture for GUI verification
